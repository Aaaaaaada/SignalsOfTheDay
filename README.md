Signals of the Day
==================

This is a collection of signals interesting for historical or cultural reasons.
Each signal is described and analyzed in an [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

1. [Tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Tutorial/Tutorial.ipynb) 
   A short introduction to python, numpy, anaconda, etc.

2. [Lehman Brothers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Lehman_Brothers/LehmanBrothers.ipynb)
   A notebook giving a flavor of financial data analysis by looking at the
   Lehman Brothers stock value around the time of the 2008 finacial crash.

3. [Sputnik](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Sputnik/Sputnik.ipynb)
   The first man-made signal coming from outer space.

4. [Floods of the Nile](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Floods_of_the_Nile/FloodsOfTheNile.ipynb)
   The height of the floods of the Nile is one of the first signal that was systematically recorded
   in history. As we will see, it was very important for the Egyptian civilization.

5. [I Feel Fine](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/I_feel_fine/I%20feel%20fine.ipynb)
   A digital analysis of the famous song by the Beatles.

6. [Moiré Pattern](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Moire_Pattern/Moire.ipynb)
   The Moiré pattern is phenomenon visible on images where very regular patterns are inappropriately downsampled.

7. [Room Acoustics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Room_Acoustics/Room%20Impulse%20Response.ipynb)
   A fascinating glimpse in the world of room impulse responses.

8. [Safecast](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LCAV/SignalsOfTheDay/blob/master/Safecast/Safecast.ipynb)
   An introduction to band-limited interpolation. The technique presented is then applied to crowdsourced
   radioactivity measurements collected in Japan after the Fukushima disaster.
